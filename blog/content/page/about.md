Fortunately, being an expert is not a requirement for enthusiasm otherwise nobody would be allowed to get excited about anything (and likely, nobody would ever manage to become an expert). Hence, the theme of this blog is one of stubborn enthusiasm for anything sufficiently interesting.

This blog is partially professional, partially personal and may contain content regarding anything from machine learning code snippets to progress pics of my orchids. I am passionate about Golang. I enjoy mathematics, though I certainly don't have the gall to call myself a mathematician. I am an avid gardener: I find the trick is to keep more things alive than you accidentally kill. My MSc was in the field of nature-inspired computing, particularly regarding the use of particle swarm optimization in high dimensional search spaces. So you might find a few articles ranting about PSO or other computational intelligence topics. Lately, my interest has turned towards deep learning and adversarial attacks on machine learning models, which will hopefully be the topic of my PhD.

Perhaps something in these pages might pique your interest.
